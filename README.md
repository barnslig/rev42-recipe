Recipe
------
We are working on the initial (and forkable) version.
The idea of Leonard is to combine juice (referring to Rainer at CCC HH who said that nerds consuming only pizza and club-mate had an unhealthy lifestyle) with caffeine and Yerba Mate. Whereas Oleander wants to develop a drink without juice. Surely not easy...

### Oleander's version ###
It contains water, shugar (stevia for non-EU markets), Yerba Mate... [ fix me ]

### Leonard's version ###
A juicy-'healthy'-thingy (caffeine can't be healthy. thihihi)...
