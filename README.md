Recipe
------
We are working on the initial (and forkable) version.
The idea of Leonard is to combine juice (referring to Rainer at CCC HH who
said that nerds only consume pizza and club-mate had an unhealthy lifestyle)
with caffeine and Yerba Mate. Whereas Oleander wants to develop a drink
without juice. Surely not easy...

### Oleander's __initial__ version ###

#### Ingredients ####

* as much sparkling water as possible (e.g. Vitaqua Quelle CLASSIC from ALDI Nord named Quellbrunn or from REWE named ja!)
* Yerba Mate (roasted if possible; mine was a "little" bit too old; five years over the minimum durability date)
* any other herbs you like
* (cane) sugar
* boiled water
* a funnel
* a splash of lemon
* Duct tape and a straw, tube or whatever you can use to add your sparkling
  water to the  mixture without losing the co2.
* a fine-meshed and a large-meshed sieve
* two pots or something similar
* bottle and bottle top (e.g. one of these bottle openers made from plastic)

#### What you need to do ####
First, pour boiled water into one pot. Add the Mate (don't use too little!)
and let it brew for about seven minutes. Bring the large-meshed sieve in
position and put it onto the unused pot. Take the pot with the Mate and flip
it over above the sieve. When it's drained, add the other herbs and let it
brew for three to ten minutes (depending on the herbs).  Use cold water to
clean the pot you used to brew the Mate. Mount the sieve you just used. Now
flip the pot above the sieve.  Add the (cane) sugar and a splash of lemon to
the tea, stir it and leave to cool.

Now attach a straw / tube to the funnel and affix it with some duct tape.

Insert the tube into the bottle and pour mixture in through the fine-meshed
sieve. Next, fill the bottle with the sparkling water; try not to pour too
fast or slow.

Add the botte top and let the fridge do the rest!
Enjoy it cold!

### Leonard's version ###
#### Ingredients ####
* A green mate tea bag
* Hot water

#### How to make it ####
Put the tea bag into a cup, add the hot water and wait for 7 to 10 minutes.
