Recipe
------
We are working on the initial (and forkable) version.
The idea of Leonard is to combine juice (referring to Rainer at CCC HH who
said that nerds only consume pizza and club-mate have an unhealthy lifestyle)
with caffeine and Yerba Mate. Whereas Oleander wants to develop a drink
without juice. Certainly not easy...

### Oleander's __initial__ version ###

(Loosely translated from [Etherpad](http://piratepad.net/EuHzx9YOQT), v2220)

#### Ingredients ####

* 1.5g grinded Guarana
* 1.2g grinded Kola nut (maybe? has a really strong taste...)
* 50g roasted Mate
* 200ml still water
* 2L sparkling water
* 4 Tbsp. Sugar
* 1g Lapacho (maybe less? the current taste is quite strong)
* 1g lemon grass
* 1g melissa

#### Procedure ####

* moisturize the Mate with warm water
* Let Mate simmer with still water for about 8 minutes
* Pour through two sieves (first a large-meshed, then a fine one) into another
  pot
* Add Lapacho when it's hot again (but before it's cooking)
* Wait 1 minute, add grinded Guarana
* Wait 1 minute, add melissa
* Let it draw for 4 to 5 minutes at a constant temperature
* Pour through a fine sieve into another (preferably metal) pot
* Add suger and lemon grass, mix well
* Let it draw again for 3 minutes
* Pour through a fine sieve into another container
* Add two dashes of citric acid
* Let it cool

* Pour 50ml of the previously created Mate concentrate into a bottle
* Fill with sparkling water, let out as little carbon dioxide as
  possible (try using a funnel with a tube)
* Close bottle
* Let it cool

That's it. As you can see, the recipe is by no means finished yet. Any
comments are welcome.

### Leonard's version ###
#### Ingredients ####
* A green mate tea bag
* Hot water

#### Procedure ####
Put the tea bag into a cup, add the hot water and wait for 7 to 10 minutes.
